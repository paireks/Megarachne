## Purpose

Megarachne can help you to use graph theory with Grasshopper.

## How it works?

Megarachne allows you to convert Rhino/Grasshopper geometry into graphs and solve specific problems with it.

Actually all the Megarachne's graphs are directed and all of the edges have weights that are equal to the length of these edges.

## Features (1.0.0)

## About the code

No external plugins were used to deal with graph theory.

Code is not designed to be used outside Grasshopper environment.

Brontosaurus plug-in was used to create automatic tests inside Grasshopper.
